# MusicTutorAnalyzer
Analyze statistics from Music Tutor application. I've been training from scratch of learning F key musical note reading over long time. Each day I did one exercise, and my skill learning process can be depicted in the statistic page. 

# Instructions
1. connect smartphone to wide screen (e.g. with samsung hex) to have high-resolution screen-shot of the statistics page.
2. open the snapshot in GIMP or any photo editor to identify origin pixel location.
3. adjust vertical spacing.
4. run the analysis code to extract the actual plot data form the image.
5. make any analysis upon that data. E.g. for mine I can see an exponential learning curve with a jump and then steadiness when I started using it not immediately after waking up.
